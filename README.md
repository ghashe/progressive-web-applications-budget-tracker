## Description

This Budget Tracker is a progressive web application (PWA) that lets users track their budget by adding expenses and deposits via the "Add/Subtract Funds" button. Transactions can be added with or without a connection. Offline transactions are stored in the indexedDB and then transferred back to the database when the user comes back online.
